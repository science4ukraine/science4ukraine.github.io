                    Menon’s research in the Laboratory for Nano and Micro Photonics (LaNMP) focuses on light-matter interactions at the nanoscale. 
                    His group explores emergent classical and quantum material properties that arise in engineered electromagnetic environments, with the goal 
                    of creating programmable matter through hybrid light-matter quasiparticles. This work aims to uncover fundamental limits of light-matter 
                    control and enable applications in quantum simulation, energy harvesting, ultrafast light emission, and catalysis.

                    Rein Ulijn’s research group is developing bio-inspired nanotechnology. The fundamental research question that drives his work is how the 
                    molecular building blocks and processes of life can be repurposed, combined and simplified to produce functional materials with designed 
                    properties and functions that cannot be achieved using existing design approaches. The resulting materials can be produced from sustainable 
                    sources and are finding wide-ranging applications ranging from energy harvesting, to sustainable plastics, personal care, sensing, biomedicine.

                    Kevin H. Gardner’s research focuses on how cells sense and respond to environmental cues through sensory protein domains that regulate 
                    protein-protein interactions. By combining biophysics, biochemistry, and cell biology—often in collaboration with other labs—his group 
                    investigates how diverse proteins use shared signaling mechanisms across different biological contexts. This work has informed both the 
                    natural understanding of these systems and their artificial control, contributing to developments such as anti-cancer drugs and optogenetic tools.

                    Brumberg studied Biology at Williams College and then earned a PhD in Neurobiology 
                    from the University of Pittsburgh studying how the rat integrates information from multiple facial 
                    whiskers using physiological and computational techniques. In his laboratory he utilizes physiological 
                    and anatomical methods to study how environmental experience impacts the development 
                    and function of cortical circuits. Dr. Brumberg has published over 60 peer-reviewed articles 
                    and has received multiple grants from the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of
                    Health. Currently, his research focuses on how sensory experience shapes the development of cortical circuits. 
                    In addition to his scholarly work Dr. Brumberg has served several administrative functions within CUNY, 
                    including directing their doctoral training in Psychology and is presently the Dean for the Sciences at 
                    The CUNY Graduate Center, in charge of CUNY’s PhD programs in the sciences.

                    Research in the Hauber research group (@cowbirdlab) focuses on the evolution of avian social recognition systems. 
                    Shifting gears between behavioral, developmental, physiological, and molecular tools, we study the social and genetic consequences of species
                     recognition in avian brood parasites, such as cuckoos, cowbirds, and whydahs, and their hosts. Obligate brood parasitism in birds provides an 
                     exciting model system for the evolution of social behaviors because, unlike 99% of bird species, they lay their eggs into nests of other species 
                     and are reared by foster parents. Several other projects in the lab tap into national and international collaborations throughout the world of birds, 
                     including the unique and often endangered sea- and shorebird fauna of New Zealand, as well as mammals, spiders, and other organisms from around the globe.

                    The Koder Lab focuses on computational protein design to expand the capabilities of synthetic biology. Ronald Koder's lab creates novel proteins from scratch
                     with new functions or properties and integrates them with natural proteins or materials to develop new enzymes, materials, and organisms. These systems
                      have applications in medicine, defense, green catalysis, and sustainable energy. By combining de novo protein design with naturally 
                      occurring proteins, his work aims to push the boundaries of biology to address global challenges.
